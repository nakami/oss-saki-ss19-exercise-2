In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\\n\\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible.

WAAS combines Cisco's Wide Area\\nFile Services (WAFS-products allow remote office users to access and share files globally at\\nLAN speeds over the WAN) with WAN optimization inside of a router, accelerating TCP-based\\napplications on a given network.\\n• WAAS system consists of a set of devices called wide area application engines (WAEs) that work\\ntogether to optimize TCP traffic over your network. When client and server applications attempt\\n\\n\\n\\nto communicate with each other, the network intercepts and redirects this traffic to the WAEs so\\nthat they can act on behalf of the client application and the destination server.\\n• The WAEs examine the traffic and use built-in application policies to determine whether to\\noptimize the traffic or allow it to pass through your network un optimized\\n• Mainly involves optimizing the various Ao's like HTTP, SSL, HTTPS and functional wise platform\\ncheck.\\n\\nPRODUCT WAAS(Wide Area Application Services)\\n\\nEDUCATION\\n\\nB.E in CSE\\n\\nANNA University\\n\\n2011\\n\\nDay Adventist Matric Hr.Sec School\\n\\n2005 to 2007\\n\\nSKILLS\\n\\noptimization (2 years), Python (4 years), router (4 years), TCL (4 years), Testing (4 years)\\n\\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\\n\\nTechnical Skills\\nProgramming Languages Python, TCL, Power Query, SQL, Shell Scripting, C#\\nConcepts Networking, WAAS (Wan Optimization), WAAS on Router, WAE(Wide Area Engine),\\nWCCP Protocol,\\nAutomation Framework ATS (Automated Test System), Selenium Testing Framework\\nIDE(Integrated Development Environment) Eclipse, Pycharm, Pydev[Plugin for eclipse IDE]\\nSoftware\\nEclipse CDETS & Rally (Bug Tracking), eARMS (Regression testing), ACME(Versioning),\\nTIMS(Reporting), HTMLTestRunner, Power Query(Automation), ARAS PLM(Product Lifecycle\\nManagement), AML Studio (adaptive markup language)\\n\\nOperating Systems Windows XP/10, Linux\", {'entities': [[7652, 7662, 'Degree'], [102, 166, 'Email Address'], [0, 25, 'Name']]}], [\"Yathishwaran P\\nMaximo Consultant - Infosys Limited\\n\\nNamakkal, Tamil Nadu - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Yathishwaran-P/a9c8d42210af40b8\\n\\n• Maximo Consultant in Infosys Limited, Chennai from August 2013 till date (around 4.8 years)\\n• IT professional with 4.4 years of experience in BIRT reporting, application support in IBM MAXIMO\\nApplication.\\n• IBM Certified MAXIMO ASSET MANAGEMENT, PURCHASE ORDER, PROCUREMENT, PURCHASE\\nREQUISITION Professional\\n• Submitted Internal tutorial document on Configuration of Hover Dialogs and Its usage in Maximo\\nV7.6\\n• Worked on various customer requirements and having overall experience with\\n➢ Preventive Maintenance\\n➢ Maximo automation and implementation\\n➢ MBO customizations\\n➢ Data Supply chain\\n➢ Portals, Workflows Designing\\n➢ Reports/Query Creation\\n➢ Work order tracking, Invoicing, Purchase order\\n➢ Asset Management\\n➢ Maximo Integration Framework (MIF)\\n➢ Labors, Crews, Security Group Set up\\n➢ Domains, Database configuration\\n➢ Basics of BIRT, Cognos Reporting, Monitor logs from Admin console.\\n➢ Maximo Java customization\\n➢ Maximo Installation/Upgradation\\n➢ Basic WebSphere function\\n\\n• Strong interpersonal skills and the ability to work in team efficiently.

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\\n\\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible.

In the reversible data hiding method, First empty room\\nis made by embedding LSBs of some pixels into other pixels with RDH method and\\nthen encrypt the image, so the positions of these LSBs in the encrypted image can\\nbe used to embed data .In the first phase, a content owner encrypts the original\\nuncompressed image using an encryption key. Then, a data-hider compress the\\nleast significant bits of the encrypted image using a data-hiding key to create a\\nsparse space to accommodate some additional data. If the receiver has both key\\ndata-hiding key and the encryption key, it can extract the secret data and recover\\nthe original image.\", {'entities': [[1915, 1956, 'Email Address'], [720, 723, 'Degree'], [626, 631, 'Degree'], [507, 515, 'Degree'], [55, 96, 'Email Address'], [0, 11, 'Name']]}], ['Gohil kinjal\\nLooking for Android dveloper\\n\\nIN surendranagar - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Gohil-kinjal/f9d60e3a5b27a464\\n\\nIT Professional seeking a challenging and rewarding opportunity with an organization of repute\\nwhich recognizes and utilizes my true potential while nurturing my analytical and technical skills\\nin the field of IT.\\n\\nWilling to relocate: Anywhere\\n\\nWORK EXPERIENCE\\n\\nAndroid Application Developer\\n\\nFRESHERS\\n\\nEDUCATION\\n\\nMsc.it in ANDROID\\n\\nSauratra University -  Surendranagar, Gujarat\\n\\n2018\\n\\nBachelor of Computer Aplication in Computer Aplication\\n\\nSauratra University -  Surendranagar, Gujarat\\n\\n2016\\n\\nSKILLS\\n\\nJAVA (Less than 1 year), ANDROID (Less than 1 year), Kotlin\\n\\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\\n\\nTechnical skill:\\n❖ OPERATING SYSTEM\\n\\n➢ Window 10\\n❖ LANGUAGES\\n\\n➢ Android, Kotlin, HTML, Java\\n\\nhttps://www.indeed.com/r/Gohil-kinjal/f9d60e3a5b27a464?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN', {'entities': [[820, 862, 'Email Address'], [513, 567, 'Degree'], [441, 458, 'Degree'], [82, 124, 'Email Address'], [0, 12, 'Name']]}], ['k.balaji krishnamoorthy\\nChennai, Tamil Nadu - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/k-balaji-krishnamoorthy/\\ne9b629d267dd02cd\\n\\nWORK EXPERIENCE\\n\\nIT\\n\\nhcl and tcs wipro\\n\\nqual for any requirement for freshers\\n\\nsoftware testing\\n\\nIT\\n\\nsame defined\\n\\nEDUCATION\\n\\ndipoloma ece and BE ECE\\n\\njaya engineering college\\n\\nSKILLS\\n\\nSoftware Testing, Sql Dba, C++, C#, Html5\\n\\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\\n\\nall company equal preference job\\n\\nhttps://www.indeed.com/r/k-balaji-krishnamoorthy/e9b629d267dd02cd?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN\\nhttps://www.indeed.com/r/k-balaji-krishnamoorthy/e9b629d267dd02cd?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN', {'entities': [[248, 271, 'Degree'], [66, 120, 'Email Address'], [0, 23, 'Name']]}], ['Kalyani Parihar\\nAkola, Maharashtra - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Kalyani-Parihar/c3a3723e8b6f12cd\\n\\nSeeking a challenging position in an organization which gives me a chance to improve my\\nknowledge and enhance my skills and be a part of the team that excels in the work towards the\\ngrowth of organization and gives me a vital experience.\\n\\nWilling to relocate: Anywhere\\n\\nWORK EXPERIENCE\\n\\nfreshers\\n\\nFreshers\\n\\nEDUCATION\\n\\nH.S.C.\\n\\nMaharashtra State Board\\n\\nS.S.C.\\n\\nMaharashtra State Board\\n\\nSKILLS\\n\\nINTERNET EXPLORER (Less than 1 year), MS OFFICE (Less than 1 year), OPTICAL (Less than 1\\nyear), REFRACTOMETER (Less than 1 year), SPECTROPHOTOMETER (Less than 1 year)\\n\\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\\n\\nComputer Knowledge:\\n\\n• TOOLS - Basic Computer Application (MS office, Internet Explorer)\\n• OS-Window […]\\n\\nInstrumental skills acquired:\\n\\n➢ Electronic weighing balance\\n➢ Ph meter\\n➢ Muffle furnace\\n➢ Burst strength tester\\n➢ Hot air oven\\n➢ Optical density measurement apparatus\\n➢ Refractometer\\n➢ Thermometer\\n➢ Ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer\\n\\nhttps://www.indeed.com/r/Kalyani-Parihar/c3a3723e8b6f12cd?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN\\n\\n\\nAcademic Project Work Completed:\\n\\nProject title-\"Recycling of waste\\nDescription: -Recycling of waste is process of recovering chemicals as well as used for maximum\\nyield of product.\\nSeminar title- Construction and working of electrostatic precipitator.\\nDescription - It is a dust removal device, dust present in flue gases are remove by passing\\nflue gases through electrostatic precipitator.Which has highest efficiency of removing dust\\nparticle.about 99% dust are removed.', {'entities': [[1045, 1090, 'Email Address'], [422, 427, 'Degree'], [57, 102, 'Email Address'], [0, 15, 'Name']]}], [\"Mohd.
